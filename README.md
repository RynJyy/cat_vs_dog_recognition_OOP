# üê∂ Cats vs üê± Dogs Classifier (with GUI)
---

## üìå About

This project is a Python-based image classification system that distinguishes between cats and dogs using transfer learning with MobileNetV2. It includes two main components:

- A training pipeline that prepares, augments, and trains a model using TensorFlow and Keras.
- A graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter, allowing users to upload an image and receive a real-time prediction.
- Designed for both educational and practical use, the codebase demonstrates the four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)‚Äîencapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism‚Äîthrough clear class structures and modular design.

Whether you're training your own model or simply exploring how machine learning integrates with GUI applications, this project offers a full end-to-end example.

## üöÄ Features

- ‚úÖ Transfer learning with MobileNetV2 for high accuracy
- ‚úÖ Data augmentation for improved generalization
- ‚úÖ Clean and colorful GUI to classify images
- ‚úÖ Clear separation of model training and GUI code
- ‚úÖ Interactive buttons: Upload, Clear, Exit

## üì¶ Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Pillow
- Tkinter (usually included with Python)

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy pillow
```

---

## üß† Model Training

Train the model on your dataset:

```bash
python main_train_model.py
```

This will save the model as `dogs_vs_cats_transfer.h5`.

---

## üíª Run the GUI App

After training, launch the classifier GUI:

```bash
python main_app_gui.py
```

Upload any image of a cat or dog and see the prediction!

## üë®‚Äçüè´ OOP Principles Demonstrated

1. Encapsulation
   - Each class (ImageClassifier, CatDogClassifier, and CatDogClassifierGUI) encapsulates its data and methods.

2. Abstraction
   - Complex processes like training, loading data, or GUI interactions are abstracted into simple method calls.

3. Inheritance
   - CatDogClassifier inherits from ImageClassifier to extend functionality while reusing core logic.

4. Polymorphism
   - Methods like load_data() or build_model() behave differently depending on the subclass implementing them.

## üñºÔ∏è GUI Preview

> Includes a background image, stylized labels, and result display. You can customize the `background.jpg` file.

---

## üõ† How It Works

- Uses **MobileNetV2** pretrained on ImageNet (transfer learning)
- Adds a global pooling layer + dense layers on top
- Uses `ImageDataGenerator` for training and validation
- GUI uses `tkinter`, `PIL`, and `filedialog` to display and classify user images

---

## üìå Inspiration and Credits

- Inspired by [leemengtw/cat-recognition-train](https://github.com/leemengtw/cat-recognition-train) ‚Äî A great example of how to apply transfer learning for image classification.

---

## ‚úÖ To Do

- [ ] Add real-time webcam prediction (optional)
- [ ] Add model performance charts (accuracy/loss)
- [ ] Allow batch predictions from a folder
